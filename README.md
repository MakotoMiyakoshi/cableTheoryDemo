# Cable theory demo
These are demonstrations in response to my Wiki article: [Where does 1/f power distribution come from?](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Makoto%27s_preprocessing_pipeline#Where_does_power_distribution_come_from.3F_.28For_510.2C000_page_views.2C_Added_on_09.2F17.2F2025.29) This basic demonstration illustrates a moment of injecting a synaptic input to a middle point of a passive cable with the length of +/-2 lambda. The top panel shows the effect of the local sink at the synaptic input and diffuse passive return currents as sources on the extracellular electirc potential field. The bottom panel shows the same situation but showing only on the passive return currents. The synaptic input mimics an excitatory AMPA input. The bottom right panel shows a good agreement with Figure 4-10 of the Electric Fields of the Brain (Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006). For more detail, please read that main article linked.
